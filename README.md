# Glance Additons

This repo contains some additions for the [Glance](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/) dashboard.

## contents

> not a lot going on here right now

-   `custom-api/` exposes endpoints to be used in the dashboard. Reason: I didn't find a way to dynamically put the current date into a URL.

## usage

Take a look at `.env.example` files as a reference for environment variables needed by glance or custom-api

The current approach is to clone this repo to where you keep your Glance config, then add the docker-compose snippet to your stack and mount `config/`

example volume mounts from the pov of your glance directory:

```yaml
# ...
volumes:
    - ./config:/app/config # your normal config
    - ./glance-additions/config:/app/config/additions # the cloned repo
```

example of how to include a widget:

```yaml
- type: group
  widgets:
      $include: additions/mensa.yml # this path is now relative to inside the glance container
```
